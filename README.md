# webscraping-nested-dynamic-selenium
my very first nested webscraping on a dynamic website

# about the project:
the program runs through multiple nested links from the medicine list at https://www.pbs.gov.au/browse/medicine-listing. then it scraps all the information available on the individual medicines and brings back data on available brands, drug type, product code and medicine strength. The whole point of this project was to get myself familiar with dynamic website scraping and also help a chemist friend have a list of all the medicines and their available brands.

#code:
** the code scraps through three different nested pages of a same medicine in order to grab the relevent data (medicine listing page > specific medicines > available brands)
** after that, the function goes through the pages from A - Z to scrap all the relevent data of all the medicines aplhabetically.


I did get frustrated at some point as I thought I will never get this done but I am happy that I pushed through it and got it done. The feeling is as always very nice like a solving a mystery.
